tls_handshake:
* look how extensions are search get_struct and replace by tls_handshale.get_client_hello_extnstion_data


Key_Scheduler
* instantiate with psk_type ( external, resumption) instead of boolean is_ext or use is_ext in tickets

tls_cleint:
* conf is provided as an argument in function but can be replaced by self.conf

tls_client_keyless: replace ch, sh by client_hello, server_hello

tls13_struct : defining ClientHElloExtension, ServerHElloExtension, ....

certificateverify we need to check the signature.

TCP servers (with TLS) should consider long time TCP session as in lurkTLS12.

signing key should be moved from conf to crypto_utils
We should be able to generate certificates and specify a CA.

ensure cryptography has a version >= 37.0.4

pip3 install --upgrade cryptography

ensure that key files do not have a fix value and that the value being provided is used to generate the keys.
This probably requires the argument being derived from teh key / cert as opposed to from the file name.


keys are generated locally but are not considered by the tls_client. We shoudl start a tls_client without bothering the keys.

add test for facebook / goole and ericsson.com

tls_client 127.0.0.1:8402 shoudl work. currenlty it generates an error as no data has been received.
